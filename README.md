# Net-Computing
This GitHub repository contains both the client and server side code for our Net-Computing project. Our client is implemented as a Java application. The code for this can be found in the "Client" folder. The server is distributed over 3 different projects that can all be ran independent from each other. The code for all 3 projects can be found in the "Server" folder, in there you will also find setup instructions.
